# PylibMS_Presets
Public presets intended to be utilized with the [PylibMS](https://github.com/AbdyyEee/PylibMS) library. 

# Game not supported?
Request support for the game as an [issue](https://github.com/AbdyyEee/PylibMS_Presets/issues)

# Errors
Presets may not be 1:1 accurate with tag reading, as such errors may occur when utilzing a Preset.

PylibMS reports if a tag error occurs in the console, and writes all the neccessary information to a log file. To allow me to fix these problems, create an issue on this page. Specify the game and attatch the log file AND the MSBT file.
